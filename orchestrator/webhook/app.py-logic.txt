Listen to webhook proxy pass from nginx ingress server

Upon receiving signal:

try to find the valid project by checking payload signature agaisnt:
    for project in projects/$PROJECT/.env

if matching payload signature found:
    if CUSTOM_REPO_LOCATION provided:
        REPO_LOCATION=$CUSTOM_REPO_LOCATION

    if DOCKER_COMPOSE_RESTART_REQUIRED=YES:
        DOCKER_COMPOSE_RESTART_REQUIRED=YES
    else:
        if COMMIT_DOCKER_COMPOSE_RESTART_TRIGGER exists in docker commit message:
            DOCKER_COMPOSE_RESTART_REQUIRED=YES


    We then construct a file of name task$(time-and-date) use the best extension you can think of
    in this file we write:
    REPO_LOCATION= the $REPO_LOCATION
    DOCKER_COMPOSE_RESTART_REQUIRED=$DOCKER_COMPOSE_RESTART_REQUIRED
    only if CI_PEPLINE_LOCATION=
    CI_PEPLINE_LOCATION=$CI_PEPLINE_LOCATION

    we then save this file into the inotify host monitored REPO_LOCATION
    according to our docker compose file, /webhook-redeploy-instruct/ should map to the correct location

else:
    drop request
